// on hover of a specific icon, increase opacity back to normal

// Have alternating divs "blackSection" or "otherColorSection". Have the widths be 100% and the colors be the colors be the colors
// Have body and html have margin and padding 0
// Have the first section have id first
// Have the last section have id last
// Have all the divs inside the sections
// Have those psychological vertical lines drawn by keeping a lot of the margins the same
